This project's purpose was to further understand AngularJS as well as implement the use of Firebase.

This application allows users to create rooms, and chat with each other while simultaneously creating usernames which are stored in the form of cookies.

While some of the project was given direction using tutorial, most of this was a hands off approach. This was more self-led and relied heavily on outside research as well as mentor advice.
