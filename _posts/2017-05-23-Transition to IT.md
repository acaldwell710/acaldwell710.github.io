title:  The Transition to IT
---

I am a former retail manager with loads of experience in customer service. However, I am also a student studying software development with an educational background in graphic design. While I enjoyed my time helping others find the perfect daytime, workplace, or date night outfit I decided it was time to commit to my future. I am excited about the exponential growth in the IT field, however, what I am finding the hardest is trying to actually get a foot in the door. There are so many job boards, and being in a smaller town there actually isn't a large calling for the new skills that I possess. I've even talked to an IT recruiter local to the area, who believes that my newest skills are really just the basics, and that at least in this area object oriented programming is what is the focus. Therefore, that leads to me to believe that I can try to create experience for myself (e.g. making my own projects) and / or increasing the search radius of my job hunt. Good luck to all of you other job hunters! May the odds be ever in your favor.
