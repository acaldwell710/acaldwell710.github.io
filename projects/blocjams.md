short-description: BlocJams is a music playing website that houses a collection of music and allows users to play their collection.

This project's purpose was for learning while studying at Bloc.

This website is a mockup of an example music player and music database. It allows users to house a collection, view an album, and has a working music player.

Using a tutorial led instruction, I built this website. It was first created using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Then it was changed via DOM scripting. Later, it was jazzed up using jQuery. Finally, it was finished using AngularJS.
