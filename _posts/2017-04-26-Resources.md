It seems really easy to get overwhelmed when learning a new programming language. If you are new to a concept or have no premise to base your learning off of, then a good resource is really important. If you are like me, you may not have a lot of people around you that know a lot about computers in general and therefore know nothing about computer programming. I have found that one of my favorite resources on the internet has become [Codecademy](www.codecademy.com). This website not only is free, but is set up in a tutorial driven environment. The interface is user friendly, and lends itself to users of all skill levels. The website has also integrated a school of sorts in which you can pay to stay on a certain learning track. I also stumbled upon a phone app / website called [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/). This free software teaches you for free, at your own pace as well. Furthermore, you earn a certificate of completion for each course completed, which you can print out or share to your LinkedIn. If you are wanting to learn more about code and potentially help others, I suggest [FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.com/). Likely you will have to utilize other resources, but upon completing this free coding boot camp you will earn a full stack web development certificate and complete several projects.

After getting started at Bloc, I was introduced to several other great resources. One of my favorite resources has been [Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/). This video based, tutorial led learning system was an intelligent way of immersement into coding. Not only did the instructor lead your teaching, but you had to think about the answers, which you had previously been taught in the videos. Lastly, but not least, for those who prefer a less hands on approach to learning and like to really think about the answers I was given a resource in [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). To use Codewars, you actually have to ace two challenges called kata to sign up for the website. This website is a challenge driven website, where you complete challenges to rank up and earn credentials.

If you are simply in need of answer, my favorite resoures are [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/).
